                                    a training plan that fits your schedule and goals.

                                    have never been in a helicopter before their first lesson.

                                    Yes! Wearing glasses or contact lenses is not a problem. You simply need to carry
                                    a spare pair when flying. Vision requirements are based on corrected vision, so as
                                    long as your vision is good with glasses/contacts, you're fine.

                                    Some forms of colour vision deficiency may limit your flying. However, many people

                                    additional tests that may allow you to fly with certain restrictions.

                                    We recommend at least once a week, ideally twice. Flying less frequently means
                                    more time spent re-learning skills, which costs more overall. Intensive courses
                                    (3-4 times per week) are efficient but require a flexible schedule.

                                    Helicopter training requires reasonable visibility. If weather prevents flying,
                                    we'll reschedule your lesson at no extra cost. This is why flexible scheduling
                                    helps - if you can fly at short notice on good days, you'll progress faster.
