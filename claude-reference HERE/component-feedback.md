- Need testimonials element and element that connects to Google/Facebook reviews

### testimonial-carousel (Testimonial Carousel)
- We need testimonials that's for sure but we still have to work on the layout of them

---

## Editorial & Content Components

### editorial-magazine (Magazine Style)
- I quite like this style, maybe for the blog/news section
- Or for the list of adventures

### editorial-quote (Large Quote)
- We need to include some large quotes in places
- Quote: "Flying is not just about the destination—it's about the freedom to explore the world from a perspective few ever experience." — Quentin Smith, Founder

### featured-large (Large Featured)
- I love the component of the large featured
- One large featured + two smaller

---

## Layout & Navigation Components

### carousel-horizontal (Horizontal Scroll)
- I quite like this
- Horizontal carousel with peek

### masonry-grid (Masonry Grid)

  - Pre-purchase inspections
  - Aircraft management
  - Superyacht ops
  - Special training with 'Q'

### breadcrumb-navigation (Breadcrumb Navigation)
- To be implemented

---

## CTA & Conversion Components

### cta-centered (Centered CTA)
- The simple CTA is very good
- Can't be on the main page otherwise we don't know what CTA to suggest
- If it's on the discovery flight page then yes

### hero-minimal-centered (Centered Statement)
- I like the scroll element here

### footer-mega (Mega Footer)
- Yes we need a cool footer so that people when they scroll down to the bottom of the website we can CTA them properly or direct them to the right place etc.
- Give them our opening times

---

## Team & About Components

### team-grid (Team Grid)
- The team grid is very good
- 4-column team member cards with hover bio

### team-leadership (Leadership Team)
- Yes important, the names will be:
  - **Quentin Smith** - Founder & Managing Director
  - **Mackie Alcantara** - Chief Flight Instructor with a team of 4 instructors
  - **David Cross** - Chief Engineer (heads a team of 20 engineers, one guy that deals with Robinson parts, 3 people that run scheduling and client support for maintenance)
  - **Alex and Nicola** - Head of Operations with a team of 4

### founder-spotlight (Founder Spotlight)

---

## Services Components

### services-tabbed (Tabbed Services)
- Tabbed Services is neat

### specs-tabbed (Tabbed Specifications)
- The Tabbed Specifications is quite neat

### feature-grid-icons (Icon Feature Grid)
- This is an interesting idea but needs a lot of improvement

### maintenance-capabilities (Service Capabilities)
- Yes the breakdown of everything we do for service is quite important
- Not sure if this is the best option for it but it is important nevertheless to have one
- We will just have to restyle

---

## Training Components

### journey-pilot-pathway (Pilot Pathway)
- I like the text that says "ground school included" because a lot of schools don't actually include the ground school
- Going with us you are actually saving a lot
- I like the pathway for the students so they know what to expect, what they are signing up for, what the process is

### process-timeline (Process Timeline)
- I like the idea of a process timeline
- However the styling here needs a lot of work, looks hideous
- When selling the discovery flight there should be a timeline of what the person can expect on the day

---

## Lifestyle & Aspirational Components

### lifestyle-destinations (Where Will You Go?)
- Absolutely amazing component
- This is what we need - make people dream and show them what the lifestyle has to offer
- Include distance and flight time away

### lifestyle-ownership-benefits (Ownership Benefits)
- I like the idea of having a benefit component
- Although this one needs additional work to take it from not a very good example to a very good example
- But for sure benefit will be a component

### expedition-showcase (Expedition Showcase)
- We definitely need this
- However it needs to be really well done and thought through
- Adventure highlight section

---

## Events & Information Components

### events-upcoming (Upcoming Events)
- It's quite good to have the upcoming events at HQ
- That'll be nice
- Events calendar showcase

### opening-hours (Opening Hours)

- Yes we should focus on the fact that it's your turn to fly
- Charter is fine but it's a completely different thing
- You wouldn't get a driver to drive you around in your Ferrari, you want to be the one driving your Ferrari
- If you are the type of person that likes a challenge, adventure and has a James Bond type of personality then you should be flying your own helicopter
- Not have someone to fly you all the time - they are completely different things

## Page-Specific Showcase Components

### showcase-training-environment (The HQ Training Experience)
- This is good but it needs improvements to include the things that really differentiate us

### showcase-maintenance-promise (The Maintenance Promise)
- We need this sort of page however I think this version needs a lot of work to get to an acceptable standard

### showcase-parts-service (Parts When You Need Them)
- Let's create a parts supply page

### showcase-trial-experience (Your Trial Flight)
- I quite like the component that details the preflight all the way to debrief

### showcase-cost-transparency (What It Really Costs)
- Pricing page is important
- But it can't scare people off
- Seeing that big number might make people question it when in reality someone that flies a few hours a year after getting their licence it's only a few thousand
- It radically changes your life and your cool factor

### showcase-denham-location (Visit Us at Denham)
- This page is not bad

---
